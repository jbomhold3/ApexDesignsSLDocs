## System Groups
With TownControl V4, we are introducing new static groups. In version 5 these were renamed to system groups. They are quick helpers to get you to start with basic tasks. The following is a list of system groups and their abilities.
>[!NOTE]
>system groups can not be deleted.

**Administrator**
> This group is automatically assigned to the town owner. Any user with this group will be able to read, write, update, and delete from ever section in your town.

**Citizens Only, Police Only, Fire Only, Service Only, Legal Only, Education Only**
> These groups grant read, write, update, and delete permissions in their respective section only.

## Creating a group

Click New under the group's label.

>Group names cannot be changed if you need to rename a group delete it and add a new one.
