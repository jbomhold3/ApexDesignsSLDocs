## Introduction 
Introduce in Version 1. Dispatch has been a stable of TownControl. Version 3 added the ability to send messages to RadioNetwork radios directly from the website freeing the dispatcher from having to jump back and forth between windows. Version 4 changes very slight. Color coding units, giving you the ability to change your dispatch callsign in your profile. It also sorts by status then by unit number, and adds a all button to unfiltered units.

## Creating an Incident
