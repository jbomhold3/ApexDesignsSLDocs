## Introduction 
Introduce in Version 1. Dispatch has been a stable of TownControl. Version 3 added the ability to send messages to RadioNetwork radios directly from the website freeing the dispatcher from having to jump back and forth between windows. Version 4 adds color-coding on units. It gives you the ability to change your dispatch callsign in your profile, sort by status than by unit number with an added button to unfiltered units.

## Creating an Incident
