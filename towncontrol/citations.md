## Introduction 
Police Citations were introduced in Version 1. Police Citations give towns the ability to issue and track citations. Version 4 does not change this area much. We did a little reorganization on the form to make it flow better. Charges have also updated to accept an unlimited amount from the static three in before.

Additionally, we added a narrative field for them. This feature was highly requested. Citations are shared between legal and police. However, each section has different abilities.

## Creating a record Police/Legal.
Click the new icon at the right of the screen. Use the citizen search to pre-fill data or type it in yourself. Input any information required before hitting submit stand near the person you're issuing the citation to in Second Life and attach the police tablet, then click submit the form. Doing so will give the person in Second Life an option to sign, pay, or refuse to sign the citation.
