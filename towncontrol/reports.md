## Introduction 
Since introduced in version 2 reports have been a very useful feature for towns to maintain there own custom data. However, they were not without flaws. Version 3 added a feature to automatically read a subject field in the report template. However it wasn't a really well understood solution. With version 4 we think we have the best solution for the issue. Reports now have a file name, The subject can be directly a Town Registration or Social Registration. For searching all related documents to that person. You can also place them in custom folders you create with unlimited subfolders, transfer them as copies or orginal between all departments. Reguardless of that department has the same template or not. Best of all the templates are now saved with the report. No more worring about lossing reports if the template gets deleted.

## Creating a report.
Click New on the far right. If you wish to attach it to a person use the citizen search field. Fill out the name, select a report template. You can hand fill the subject if its not related to a citizen, then select a status. Each report is different depending on how the town owner creates it.
