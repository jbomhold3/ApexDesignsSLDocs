## Introduction 
Since introduced in version 2, reports have been a very useful feature for towns to maintain there own custom data. The subject can be directly a Town Registration or Social Registration. For searching all related documents to that person. You can also place them in custom folders you create with unlimited subfolders, transfer them as copies of original between all departments. Regardless of that department has the same template or not. Best of all, the templates are now saved with the report. No more worrying about losing reports if the template gets deleted.

## Creating a report.
Click New on the far right. If you wish to attach it to a person, use the citizen search field. Fill out the name, select a report template. You can hand fill the subject if it's not related to a citizen, then select a status. Each report is different depending on how the town owner creates it.
