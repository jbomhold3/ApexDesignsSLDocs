# Welcome to TownControl

## What is TownControl
TownControl is a platform for managing various aspects of your Second Life city or town. These areas can include but are not limited to divers Licensees, License plates, Reports, Citations, ext. TownControl aims to be your one-stop-shop for managing all roleplay aspects of your modern community. Town Control can be used on other platforms however, this is not the goal of the system. In the future, we may launch a version of TownControl that has zero ties to Second Life is there is enough interest to use the Github link below. 

## Feature requests and bug reporting.

TownControl has evolved over the years adding new features and abilities.  We always welcome your suggestions, even if you are not a product owner. Many user feature request continues to make it into the system. While our goal is to provide a quick and responsive, quality product from time to time, bugs do happen.
