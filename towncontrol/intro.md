## What is TownControl
TownControl is a platform for managing various aspects of your Second Life city or town. These areas can include but are not limited to divers Licensees, License plates, Reports, Citations, ext. TownControl aims to be your one-stop-shop for managing all roleplay aspects of your modern community. Town Control can be used on other platforms however, this is not the goal of the system. In the future, we may launch a version of TownControl that has zero ties to Second Life is there is enough interest to use the Github link below.
