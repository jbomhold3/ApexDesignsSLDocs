## Introduction 
Personnel Rosters have been in the system since conception with little changes. Giving you the ability to keep track of your personnel and vehicles. Version 4 aims to improve on rosters. First, we split vehicle rosters out of personnel rosters. We also have the ability to attach an employee by Town Registration and added notes and hired date section. 

## Creating a record.
Click the new icon at the right of the screen. Use the citizen search to pre-fill data or type it in yourself. Input any information you require and click submit.
