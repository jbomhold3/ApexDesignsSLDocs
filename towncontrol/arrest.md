## Introduction 
Version 4 is introducing an Arrest section. Arrests will give towns the ability to track inmates. Arrests are shared between legal and police. When you're viewing them from the Legal section, you must have the correct Legal section permissions. When you're viewing them from the Police section, you must have the correct Police section permissions.
