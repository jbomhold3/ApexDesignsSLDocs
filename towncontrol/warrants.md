## Introduction 
Introduce in Version 2. Warrants give towns ability to issue a warrant for someones arrest across all towns if selected. Version 4 does not change this area much. However, it does change the way case numbers are generated we now use the YYYYMMDD-## format for case numbers. Case numbers are in UTC time. The number part of the case number will reset to 01 at the end of each day. Warrants now show only active cases old warrants can be looked at under the soon to come criminal records.
