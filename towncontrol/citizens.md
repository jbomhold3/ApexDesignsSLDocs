Shown above is the citizen's page with a selected citizen.

## Introduction 
TownControl uses a unified social registration system. Each citizen in the system has a shared social registration record, and a private Town Registration record. The citizens page is filtered between citizens and companies.

## Creating a Town Registration
To create a new citizen click the new button. Follow the steps on screen. Social Registration must be searched to ensure no unnecessary duplicate data is entered into the system. Enter all requested fields and click save.

## Editing a Town Registration
Simply click the edit icon in the list. It will redirect you to the users record.

## Vehicles
This is a list of vehicles the selected Town Registration owns. Mainly for added realism, it useful to pre-fill Vehicle Registrations later on. However, this area is not required. VIN is generated automatically.

## Titles
Once again this is added for realism however you can print out titles to vehicles if your town owner has created a generic template.

## Registrations
Registrations are used for printing license plates for vehicles. If you created a vehicle you can select it when creating or editing. Numbers left blank are generated automatically.
