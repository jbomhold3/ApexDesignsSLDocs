# Report Templates

## Exploring the builder

From top to bottom, the file icon is new, the folder icon is open, and the disk icon is to save. 

The report name field and group the template can be created in. 

Export will save the load report template as a json file to your hard drive. 

Import will replace the current report template with the contents of a exported json file.

Under that, the toolbar you have a list of components you can create. You drag and drop them into the preview pane on the right. 

## Creating Report Templates
When you first enter the page, you are given an unsaved new report. You can choose the components and options you want on it by dragging and dropping them to the left pane.
>[!NOTE]
>As of version 4, report templates not have a undo(ctrl+z) and redo(ctrl+y) option. You can undo up to 7 changes.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Reports are saved in the browsers local storage. This means if you lose connection to the internet, you can continue to create or edit the report and save it when your connection returns. This also means if you close the window by mistake, your data is not lost. When you return to the report builder, it will automatically load unsaved data.

## Opening and deleting report templates
Templates can be opened by click the folder icon. A new dialog will appear.
