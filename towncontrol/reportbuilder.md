# Report Templates

## Exploring the builder

From top to bottom the file icon is new, the folder icon is open and the disk icon is save. 

The report name field, and group the template can be created in. 

>[!NOTE]
>Load Template is disabled currently these will be presets fields to add to your reports.

Under that the toolbar you have a list of component you can create. You drag and drop them into the preview paine on the right. 

## Creating Report Templates
When you first enter the page you are given a unsaved new report. You can choice the components and options you want on it by dragging and dropping them to the left paine. 
>[!NOTE]
>As of version 4 report templates not have a undo(ctrl+z) and redo(ctrl+y) option. You can undo up to 7 changes.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>As of version 4 report templates are not saved in real time. Instead its saved in the browsers local storage. This means if you loss connection to the internet you can continue to create the report and save it when you connection returns. This also means if close the window by mistake your data is not lost. When you return to the report builder it will automatically load unsaved data. 

## Opening and deleting report templates
Templates can be opened by click the folder icon. A new dialog will appear.
